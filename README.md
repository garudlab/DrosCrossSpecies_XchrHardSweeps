The documentation to clean and process the data across all _Drosophila_ species can be found in the **_DataProcessingAndAnalysis_** directory. This directory contains the following subdirectories:

  * **Code_Dmelanogaster**: Associated code used to process and analyze data from the both populations of _D. melanogaster_.
   
  * **Code_DsechDsantDteiDmau**: Associated code used to process and analyze _D. sechellia, D. santomea, D. teissieri_ and _D.mauritiana_.
  
  * **Code_Dsimulans**:  Associated code used to process and analyze _D. simulans_.
  
  * **code_misc**: Code used for additional analyses.

Code used to run simulations can be found in the **_Simulations_** directory. Under this directory there is a directory per simulated scenario with all of its associated code. These include: Bottlenecks, Background selection, Sex Bias, lower X-linked mutation rate, soft and hard sweeps.
